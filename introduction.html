		<h1 id="earlylife">Early life</h1>
		<p>On March 27, 1981, Lin Junjie was born in a music family in Singapore. Although he has been learning classical piano since the age of 4, he is not strictly speaking a music class, but a background in art. When he was a child, JJ Lin regarded his brother as an idol, and followed his brother's footsteps to do anything. After getting in touch with popular music, he fell in love with the path of creation.
            In 1996, JJ Lin began to participate in various singing competitions and won several awards for songwriting and singing. In 1999, Haidie Music discovered him in the "very singer training class". This shy and unremarkable high school student showed his innocent passion for music when he played and sang. At that time, Lin Junjie, who had excellent academic performance, gave up his education after receiving the admission notice of the National University of Singapore, and signed a contract with Haidie, thus starting his music path.
		</p>
		<p>Singaporean men are required to perform military service, and JJ Lin is no exception. Because of his expertise, he joined the Singapore Armed Forces Art Corps. During his military service, he accumulated a lot of stage performance experience and also tried countless creations. Although he was repeatedly "shot at guns" in the early days, under the correct guidance and encouragement of the teacher, he was extremely talented and worked very hard, and finally composed a song that was approved by the teacher. This is "Remember" included in the album of Zhang Huimei in 2001. . Since then, Lin Junjie has composed many main songs for Yu Chengqing, Adu, Wang Xinling and others, and his creative talents are finally displayed</p>

        <h3>FAMILY</h3>
		<p>JJ Lin held a new album pre-order press conference. Mom suddenly showed up and took out the cane that had been "serving" him since he was a child. He was moved to tears. Lin's mother was as strict as a tiger's mother. He secretly threw the cane away. I still got the lantern handle and hit him bleeding, leaving scars on his hands. The record company had already decided that Ma Lin would come to the platform from Singapore. The whole family knew about the itinerary, but he was kept in the dark. He thumped his chest: "I can't believe that they acted on me during the Chinese New Year." Before coming to the stage, Ma Lin specially bought the cane, which made JJ Lin look pleasantly surprised and funny. He blew himself up when he was a child. He liked to play pranks with his brother everywhere. Once he spat in his father's car and was repaired by his mother. Dodging in the back seat made mother even more angry.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>FRIEND</h3>
        <p>Speaking of brotherhood with Lin Junjie, Zhang Huaiqiu said that the two have common interests, including playing ball and video games, and they also like to joke. In private, apart from eating and chatting together, they also drive up the mountain to enjoy the night view together. He is especially unforgettable the funny incident that happened on the mountain, "We saw him playing with his mobile phone when we saw the night scene, because he was a serious "head-down clan". Suddenly, I saw a group of students on the right rushing towards us and took papers. Hebi asked us to sign and took pictures with us. It turned out that Junjie wrote on his Facebook page that we were watching the night scene, but the students from the school next door rushed over. He just loves to share with others and didn't think so much. "</p>
